To create a .gitignore file for a C# 8 project, you can include the following patterns to ignore files generated during the build process and other files that are not necessary to be tracked by Git:

```plaintext
# Ignore Visual Studio files
.vs/
*.suo
*.user
*.sln.docstates
*.userprefs

# Ignore ReSharper files
_ReSharper*/
*.resharper
*.DotSettings

# Ignore build output
bin/
obj/

# Ignore NuGet packages
packages/

# Ignore build artifacts
*.apk
*.aab
*.dll
*.exe
*.pdb
*.msi
```

You can customize this list based on your specific project's build configuration and additional files you want to ignore. 

Just create a new file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project and paste in the contents above. Git will then start ignoring the files and directories specified, which can help keep your repository clean.
